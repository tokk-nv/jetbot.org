# Getting Started

## Pick your vehicle!

To get started with JetBot, first pick your vehicle (hardware) you want to make.

For details of NVIDIA-designed open-source JetBot hardware, check [Bill of Materials](bill_of_materials.md) page and [Hardware Setup](hardware_setup.md) page.

To find kits available from 3rd parties, check [Third Party Kits](third_party_kits.md) page.


## Steps 

Follow these steps to jump into the fun of learning AI with JetBot.

![JetBot Getting Started Steps](images/steps_nvjetbot_vs_3rdparty.png)

#### 1. Get the parts from the [bill of materials](bill_of_materials.md).

> You can also start from one of the pre-bundled [third party kits](third_party_kits.md). 

#### 2. Follow the [hardware setup](hardware_setup.md)

> If you are using a third party JetBot kit, follow the manufacture's assembly instruction.  

#### 3. Follow the [software setup](software_setup/docker.md)
#### 4. Run through the [examples](examples/basic_motion.md)

After that, the rest is up to you! 

## And more!

Take the examples, modify them, make JetBot do something new, or create an entirely new AI project of your own.
