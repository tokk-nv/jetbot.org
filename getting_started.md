# Getting Started

To get started with JetBot, just follow these steps


1. Get the parts from the [bill of materials](bill_of_materials.md).

    > You can also start from one of the pre-bundled [third party kits](third_party_kits.md). 

2. Follow the [hardware setup](hardware_setup.md)
2. Follow the [software setup](software_setup/docker.md)
4. Run through the [examples](examples/basic_motion.md)

After that, the rest is up to you! 

Take the examples, modify them, make JetBot do something new, or create an entirely new AI project of your own.  

If you do something cool with JetBot, [let us know!](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/c/agx-autonomous-machines/jetson-embedded-systems/jetson-projects)

Happy JetBotting :)
