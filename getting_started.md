# Getting Started

## Step 1 - Pick your vehicle!

To get started with JetBot, first pick your vehicle (hardware) you want to make.

For details of NVIDIA-designed open-source JetBot hardware, check [Bill of Materials](bill_of_materials.md) page and [Hardware Setup](hardware_setup.md) page.

To find kits available from 3rd parties, check [Third Party Kits](third_party_kits.md) page.


## Step 2 - Setup your JetBot

After you've decided which vehicle you want to build, you'll need to source the parts and follow the setup instructions. After that, you're ready to move on to the JetBot examples!

### DIY JetBot

To get started with the DIY open-source JetBot, follow these steps.

#### 1. Get the parts from the [bill of materials](bill_of_materials.md).

#### 2. Follow the [hardware setup](hardware_setup.md)

#### 3. Follow the [software setup](software_setup/docker.md)

### Third Parth JetBot

Third party JetBot kits may have different setup instructions from the DIY JetBot. To get started with a third party jetbot, we recommend referring to the third party kit's setup instructions for details on how to setup.

## Step 3 - Follow the examples

JetBot comes with many examples to teach robotics and AI basics. These give you the experience you need to begin exploring your own applications with JetBot.

#### 1. [Basic Motion](examples/basic_motion.md) 

Learn how to program JetBot from your web browser with basic motor controls.

#### 2. [Teleoperation](examples/teleoperation.md) 

Learn how to stream live images from JetBot and control JetBot with a gamepad attached to your laptop.

#### 3. [Collision Avoidance](examples/collision_avoidance.md) 

Learn how to collect data and train a custom Image Classification model to enable JetBot to avoid collisions in a variety of scenarios. The method learned here can be extended to recognize arbitrary classes of image, which can be extended far beyond JetBot!

#### 4. [Road Following](examples/road_following.md) 

Learn how to collect data and train a custom Image Regression model to enable JetBot to follow a road. The method learned here can be extended to detect an arbitrary x, y coordinate in an image, which extends far beyond JetBot!

#### 5. [Object Following](examples/object_following.md)

Learn how to use a pre-trained object detection model for following an object, like a person, cup, or dog. The pre-trained network you'll learn to use here can be used for a variety of new AI projects.

## And more!

Take the examples, modify them, make JetBot do something new, or create an entirely new AI project of your own.
